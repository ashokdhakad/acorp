                `}
                answer={`1. Real DOM
                1. It updates slow.	
                2. Can directly update HTML.	
                3. Creates a new DOM if element updates.	
                4. DOM manipulation is very expensive.	
                5. Too much of memory wastage.	

                Virtual  DOM
                1. It updates faster.
                2. Can’t directly update HTML.
                3. Updates the JSX if element updates.
                4. DOM manipulation is very easy.
                5. No memory wastage.

                2. It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
                3. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
                4. Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it.`}

                answer={`Limitations of React are listed below:

                1. React is just a library, not a full-blown framework
                2. Its library is very large and takes time to understand
                3. It can be little difficult for the novice programmers to understand

                `}
                answer={`JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. This is a type of file used by React which utilizes the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. This makes the HTML file really easy to understand. This file makes applications robust and boosts its performance.`}

                question={`7. What do you understand by Virtual DOM? Explain its working.
                `}
                answer={`A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which originally is just the copy of the real DOM. It is a node tree that lists the elements, their attributes and content as Objects and their properties. React’s render function creates a node tree out of the React components. It then updates this tree in response to the mutations in the data model which is caused by various actions done by the user or by the system.

                `}
                answer={`Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.

                question={`9. What do you understand from “In React, everything is a component.”
                `}
                answer={`Components are the building blocks of a React application’s UI. These components split up the entire UI into small independent and reusable pieces. Then it renders each of these components independent of each other without affecting the rest of the UI.

                `}
                answer={`Each React component must have a render() mandatorily. It returns a single React element which is the representation of the native DOM component. If more than one HTML element needs to be rendered, then they must be grouped together inside one enclosing tag such as <form>, <group>,<div> etc. This function must be kept pure i.e., it must return the same result each time it is invoked.
