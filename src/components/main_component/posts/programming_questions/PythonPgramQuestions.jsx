Define a Node class which represents a node in the list. It has two properties data and next which will point to the next node.
Define another class for creating the circular linked list, and it has two nodes: head and tail. It has two methods: add() and display() .
add() will add the node to the list:
It first checks whether size is null or head is null; then it will insert the node as the head.
Both head and tail will point to a newly added node.
If the head is not null, the new node will be the new tail, and the new tail will point to the head as it is a circular linked list.
a. countNodes() will count the number of nodes present in the list.

Define new node current which will point to the head node.
Traverse through the list to count the nodes by making the current node to point to next node in the list till current points to head again.

Define a Node class which represents a node in the list. It has two properties data and next which will point to the next node.
Define another class for creating the circular linked list, and it has two nodes: head and tail. It has two methods: add(), display() and reverse().
add() will add a node to the list:
It first checks whether the head is null, then it will insert the node as the head.
Both head and tail will point to the newly added node.
If the head is not null, the new node will be the new tail, and new tail will point to head as it is a circular linked list.
a. display() will show all the nodes present in the list.

Define a new node 'current' that will point to the head.
Print current.data till current will points to head again.
Current will point to the next node in the list in each iteration.
a. reverse() will print the circular linked list in reverse order.


This method checks whether the next node to current is head which implies that, current is pointing to tail, then it will print the data of the tail node.
Recursively call reverse() by considering node next to current node and prints out all the nodes in reverse order starting from the tail.

BinaryTreeToDLL() will convert the given binary tree to the corresponding doubly linked list.
Perform inorder traversal of the binary tree by converting the left subtree first.
If the list is empty, both head and tail will point to a node.
If the list is not empty, the node will be inserted at the end of the list. Here, pointer left, and right will represent the previous and next pointer of the doubly linked list.
Now, recursively call BinaryTreeToDLL() to convert the right subtree.

Define a Node class which represents a node in the ternary tree. It will have four properties: data, left, middle, right where left, middle and right represent three children of a node.
Root will represent the root of the ternary tree. Head and tail node represent the head and tail of the doubly linked list.
convertTernaryToDLL() will convert the given ternary tree to the corresponding doubly linked list.
Nodes left, middle and right represent the child of the given node.
If the node is not null, then the node will be inserted into the list.
If the list is empty, both head and tail will point to a node.
If the list is not empty then, the node will be inserted at the end of the list. Here, pointer left, and right will represent the previous and next pointer of the doubly linked list. The middle will not point to anything hence, simply set it to null.
When a node is successfully added into the list then, call convertTernaryToDLL() recursively to add a left, middle and right child of given node to the list.
a. displayDLL() will show all the nodes present in the list.

Define a new node 'current' that will point to the head.
Print current.data till current points to null.
Current will point to the next node in the list in each iteration.

STEP 3: Loop through the first array from 0 to length of the array and copy an element from the first array to the second array that is arr1[i] = arr2[i].

print("Elements of original array: ");

STEP 3: Variable visited will be initialized with the value -1. It is required to mark an element visited that is, it helps us to avoid counting the same element again.
STEP 4: The frequency of an element can be counted using two loops. One loop will be used to select an element from an array, and another loop will be used to compare the selected element with the rest of the array.
STEP 5: Initialize count to 1 in the first loop to maintain a count of each element. Increment its value by 1 if a duplicate element is found in the second loop since we have counted this element and didn't want to count it again. Mark this element as visited by setting fr[j] = visited. Store count of each element to fr.
STEP 6: Finally, print out the element along with its frequency.
